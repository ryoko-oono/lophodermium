Furthermore, L. nitens is native to North America and there are no reliable records of it elsewhere.

(6), which has circular ascocarps the surfaces of which, when dry, are black in the center with a grey surrounding area and a black perimeter line. By contrast, ascocarps of L. kumaunicum are black whether wet or dry and are not circular. Lophodermium molitoris Minter is the third species which is similar to L. kumaunicum. It differs in having elliptical ascocarps and in being native to North America, characteristically occurring on two- to three-needle pines, whereas L. kumaunicum has rhombic ascocarps, is native to Asia and occurs on five-needle pines. Lophodermium kumaunicum also differs from other species of this genus known from pines in having asci with markedly rostrate apices. In India, L. kumaunicum occurs on P. roxburghii and probably also on similar species in subtropical to temperate mixed forest where it is likely to be native. Collections were obtained at a height of about 1850 m. Although little is known about its ecology, it seems likely that it fruits only after the needles have entered the litter, as this ecology is well established for other pinicolous Lophodermium species which produce abundant black zone lines (7).
